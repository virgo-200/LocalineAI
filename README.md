## 🔐 Privacy & Security First

LocalineAI is built with privacy as its core principle. Unlike cloud-based AI services, LocalineAI operates entirely on your local machine, ensuring that your data never leaves your device.

### Key Privacy Features

**No Cloud Dependencies** - Once installed, LocalineAI runs independently without requiring constant internet connectivity. Your AI assistant works offline, ensuring maximum privacy and availability.

**Zero Data Collection** - We don't track, store, or analyze your usage. There are no telemetry services, no usage analytics, and no data harvesting of any kind.

**Secure Local Storage** - All configuration files and generated content are stored locally with appropriate file system permissions, accessible only to your user account.
